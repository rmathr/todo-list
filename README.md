<h1 align="center" id="title">Todo List</h1>

<p id="description">This project was part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to build a todo-list app clone using JavaScript. For this project I chose to replicate <a href="https://height.app/">height</a>. On this project using localStorage to make data persistent I was able to implement my first CRUD project. This project was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. Webpack was used to bundle all modules.</p>
